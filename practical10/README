Write a function that prints on screen the sequence of moves required to solve the puzzle for any given number n. If you want to move n discs from rod 1 to rod 3, using rod 2 as an intermediary, the problem can be split into the following;
  1. If n = 1, then we simply need to move the disc from rod 1 to rod 3.
  2. If n > 1, then we want to move n-1 discs from rod 1 to rod 2 (using rod 3 as an intermediary), which leaves disc n alone on rod 1. Move that disc from rod 1 to rod 3. Finally, move the n-1 discs from rod 2 to rod 3, using rod 1 as an intermediary.
