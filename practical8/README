Write a function that returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a pair of integers passed as arguments. The GCD of two or more non-zero integers, is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4. A convenient way to find the GCD of two integers is to use the euclidian algorithm:
  GCD(a, b)
  while b 6= 0 do
    temp=b
    b=a mod b
    a=temp
  end while
  return a

gcd(a,b) = a              if b = 0
           gcd(b,a mod b) if b != 0
           
1. Use the pseudo code to construct an iterative function.
2. Construct a recursive function to do the same, using the formula below the pseudo code.
